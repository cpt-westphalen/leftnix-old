_LEFTNIX is a movie rating platform that allows the audience to see though the flashy eye-candy million dollar money laundering schemes everyone insists to call movies... and I kind of forgot how the sentence started._
_Wait... Oh, right: -to see through the movies and find out what ethics and political ideologies they present through their narative._

> Are you ready to uncover the truth?!

#### Wait, what?

LEFTNIX is a joke and it doesn't _work_ - yet.
But this joke is also a front-end practice which fetches movie data from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org 'The Movie Database Website') API. :)
